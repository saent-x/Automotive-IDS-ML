# Automotive In-vehicle IDS System Utilizing Machine Learning

In the evolving landscape of automotive technology, securing in-vehicle networks is crucial. The proposition involves a ***Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System*** (IDS) with a multi-tier hybrid architecture that integrates both ***signature-based detection*** (Supervised learning) and ***anomaly-based detection*** (Unsupervised learning). This approach combines the accuracy of ***signature-based detection*** for known threats with the adaptability of ***anomaly-based detection*** methods for new threats, offering a robust and comprehensive security solution for vehicular networks.
